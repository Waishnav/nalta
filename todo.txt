1. google api for places query
2. pseudo algorigthm
  a. query based on intrest
  b. clustering based on lattitude and longitude
  c. period of the day
  d. budget (median of whole data)

3. interest

* pseudo algorithm
1. check whether that destination exist in our db or not
2. if not,
  a. get the lattitude and longitude of destination from mapbox api
  b. using lattitude and longitude, get the places from mapbox api
  c. places will be fetch on the basis of interest

3. if yes
  a. get the places in that destination from our db with filter of interest
  b. clustering the places on the basis of lattitude and longitude (array of clusters)
  c. now we have array of clusters, we will select the cluster on the basis of period of the day
  d. number of clusters = no of days of trip
  e. assigning each itinary to each day
    1. user's interest such as adventure, historical, night-life, etc
    2. certain interest are meant to do in certain period of the day (after sunrise, after sunset, afternoon, night)
    3. assigning those task to that period of the day

* whats remaining?
1. pullling data from mapbox if not exist in our db
2. this will be middleware in b/w the request
3. which interest we will store

interests = [
  beach, lake, shopping_mall, art_gallery, landscaping, nightlife, entertainment, park, tourist_attraction, historic_site,
  temple,monument, art, nightclub, viewpoint, animal_shelter, nature_reserve, water_park, zoo, aquarium, climbing, cave, waterfall
]

* what mapbox endpoint to lookup?
1. for searching over place and getting destination info: https://api.mapbox.com/geocoding/v5/mapbox.places/mumbai,india.json?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoidmFpc2huYXY3NiIsImEiOiJjbTBjanVpdzkwM3p6Mmlxc25ha3lyZ21mIn0.vWhWfnAEsvZ2MUMRgo0u0w&types=place&limit=1
2. iterating over each interests that user has given: https://api.mapbox.com/geocoding/v5/mapbox.places/lake%2C%20shopping_mall%2C%20art_gallery%2C%20landscaping%2C%20nightlife%2C%20entertainment%2C%20park%2C%20tourist_attraction%2C%20historic_site%20in%20mumbai.json?country=in&limit=10&proximity=72.87872%2C19.077793&types=poi&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoidmFpc2huYXY3NiIsImEiOiJjbTBjanVpdzkwM3p6Mmlxc25ha3lyZ21mIn0.vWhWfnAEsvZ2MUMRgo0u0w

What's next?
1. searching using mapbox api and rendering select serchable input
2. handeling this request







New Todo:

1. migrate from sqlite to postgres for better performance
2. updating seed file for postgres
3. updating the query for fetching places from db
4. updating algorithm to assign places/itenaries to each day
