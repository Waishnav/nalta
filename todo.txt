1. google api for places query
2. pseudo algorigthm
  a. query based on intrest
  b. clustering based on lattitude and longitude
  c. period of the day
  d. budget (median of whole data)

3. interest

* pseudo algorithm
1. check whether that destination exist in our db or not
2. if not,
  a. get the lattitude and longitude of destination from mapbox api
  b. using lattitude and longitude, get the places from mapbox api
  c. places will be fetch on the basis of interest

3. if yes
  a. get the places in that destination from our db with filter of interest
  b. clustering the places on the basis of lattitude and longitude (array of clusters)
  c. now we have array of clusters, we will select the cluster on the basis of period of the day
  d. number of clusters = no of days of trip
  e. assigning each itinary to each day
    1. user's interest such as adventure, historical, night-life, etc
    2. so certain interest are meant to do in certain period of the day (after sunrise, after sunset, afternoon, night)
